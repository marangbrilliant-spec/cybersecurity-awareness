# Research Notes on Cybersecurity Threats

## 1. Phishing
Phishing involves deceptive emails or messages designed to trick users into revealing confidential information.  
**Mitigation:** Awareness training, multi-factor authentication, and email filtering.

## 2. Ransomware
Malicious software that encrypts data and demands ransom for decryption keys.  
**Mitigation:** Regular backups, reliable anti-malware, and user education.

## 3. Denial of Service (DoS)
Attackers flood servers with traffic, making resources unavailable.  
**Mitigation:** Load balancers, firewalls, and rate-limiting tools.

## 4. Password Attacks
Hackers attempt to crack weak passwords using brute force or dictionary attacks.  
**Mitigation:** Strong password policies and the use of password managers.
